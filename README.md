## Business Understanding
Preparing meals is often a challenge due to diverse individual preferences, dietary needs, and varying ingredient availability. This project aims to address these issues by developing a Personalized Recipe Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
## Problem Statement
To develop a Personalized Recipe Recommendation System that leverages Machine Learning and NLP techniques to provide customized recipe suggestions based on user preferences, ratings, and recipe content.
### Objectives
- To develop a content-based model using NLP to recommend recipes based on ingredients and instructions.
- To build a collaborative filtering model using user ratings and interactions.
- To combine both approaches into a hybrid recommendation system.
- To evaluate model performance
### Dataset Source
  The project uses the [Food.com Recipes and Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews) from Kaggle.
   -   Recipes dataset: 522,517 recipes
   -   Reviews dataset: 1.4M user reviews,ratings & comments.
